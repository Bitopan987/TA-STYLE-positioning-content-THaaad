              Theyâ€™re fluffy, independent, the internet's in love with them, and
              there is scientific proof that having a furry roomate is actually
              all kinds of good for your health.

              Several studies in the UK have found that people (especially
              women) prefer to sleep with their cats over their partners, and
              they even report sleeping better with a cat than with a human bed
              companion.

              90 percent of single women perceiving men with cats as nicer and
              more caring than those without.

              In 2002, the National Institutes of Health released a study that
              found children under a year old who were exposed to a cat to be
              less likely to develop all kinds of allergies.

              Let anyone have a plague of rats and mice,as I once had, and let
              bthem be delivered therefrom by Cats as i was, and they will have
              a lasting and kindfull regard for them.
